# Canary-Console-Chat
Connect your Canary Console to Claude via MCP - Natural Language API interaction


The following MCP allows Thinkst Canary Customers to use model interaction to 
```
1. Create Canaryttokens
2. Configure Canary Personalities
3. Manage Console Flock and Canarytoken and Canary properties
```


This is an experiment by me, I am not affilated with Thinkst, just a fan of the product and tech.

Ensure proper testing before deploying to a prodcution Canary Console.
